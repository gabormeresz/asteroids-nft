# Asteroids NFT Collection ðŸŒ 

Welcome to the Asteroids project â€” an experimental NFT collection featuring 100 unique cosmic asteroids. Each NFT within this collection is a product of the intersection between DALL-E's image generation and CHAT-GPT's copywriting, resulting in a distinctive cosmic experience.

## Project Overview

- **Web App:** The user-friendly web interface is crafted with Next.js 14 and hosted on Vercel.

- **Smart Contract:** The Asteroids NFTs are governed by a custom ERC-721 smart contract deployed on the Mumbai Testnet.

- **Metadata Hosting:** The metadata and the images for each Asteroid NFT is securely hosted on IPFS via Pinata.

- **Backend Services:** A websocket service and a backend with MongoDB connection work tirelessly on AWS to keep everything up to date.
